"""Deterministic, seedable RNG used by the harness.

Per BRIEF: every dice roll and every shuffle must be reproducible from
the seed stored in `meta.seed`. We accomplish this by carrying an
incrementing `meta.rng_state` counter that is advanced atomically with
every consumed RNG event. A given (`seed`, `rng_state`) pair always
yields the same value.

We use Python's `random.Random` with a hash-mixed key so adjacent
`rng_state` integers do not produce correlated rolls. The resulting
sequence is fully deterministic given the seed.

Usage from action handlers:

  from nevsky.rng import roll_d6, shuffle
  result = roll_d6(state)              # advances state.meta.rng_state
  shuffled = shuffle(state, ["a","b"]) # returns new shuffled list

Helpers never mutate the input list -- they return a new list.
